<h1>Madden 21 (coming soon)</h1>

<p>I know people love to shit on Madden, but I play this game <i>every</i> year - normally pre-ordering for release.</p>

<p>Now, my 11-year old son plays a lot, so I have to stay on my toes - otherwise he might whip my ass.</p>

<p>He has beat me before, but it was a 1 point, last second victory. He was on top of the world that night.</p>

<p>Every other game where I smashed him, not so much.</p>
